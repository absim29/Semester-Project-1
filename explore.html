            You can learn about Newtonian physics or even travel back in time with our resident Woolly Mammoth! The exhibits are designed for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.
            Our Young Stars club which meets once a week on Saturday from 10:00-13:00. Here you'll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts.
            During school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore.</p>
